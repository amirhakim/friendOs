## Intro

I hope that the projects that you work on, are as fun as this!

## TODO

If **time** was not an issue, these are the things I planned on doing:

1. tests :disappointed: this is the one I am most ashamed of
1. Install **Apollo**
1. Adding **GraphQL** mock server and services
1. Using **ngrx/Effects** with required success and failure actions, I created a working stub in the branch `effects`
1. Adding Search box using **pipe-filter** on the list of "friends"
1. Making the graph window resize dynamically by listening on the `window:resize` event
1. Snackbar for notifications
